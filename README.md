# 🍄 Mushroom Classification: Classical vs Quantum Machine Learning

![Mushroom](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/mushroom-cloud.png)

Welcome to the Mushroom Classification project! In this project, we explore and compare classical machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), with Quantum Machine Learning using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC). Our goal is to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Mushroom classification is a fascinating problem in the realm of machine learning. Leveraging classical and quantum approaches, we aim to understand the performance differences between these two paradigms.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Classical Machine Learning**: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) using Qiskit
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Qiskit, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy

## 📊 Results

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Accuracy on Training Set**: 85%
- **Accuracy on Test Set**: 84%
- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.16


### Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)
- **Accuracy on Training Set**: 81.55%
- **Accuracy on Test Set**: 81.35%
- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.19
